# Todo List micro-service

Experimental implementation of a Todo List restful service that uses:
1. Swagger generated Java Spring controllers
2. Kotlin for the service/business logic 
3. TinkerGraph as embedded in-memory database


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application

`./gradlew bootRun`

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/
